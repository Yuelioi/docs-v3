`int  setcurrentlight(int lightid)`

Sets the current light, and returns true when the light exists and was successfully set. The lightid should be in the set of the values returned by [getlights](getlights.html "Returns an array of light identifiers for the currently shaded surface."). The current light is used by the following shading functions:

- [renderstate](renderstate.html "Queries the renderer for a named property.")
- [getlightname](getlightname.html "Returns the name of the current light when called from within an illuminance loop, or converts an integer light ID into the light’s name.")
