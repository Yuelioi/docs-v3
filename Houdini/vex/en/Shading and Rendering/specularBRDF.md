`float  specularBRDF(vector L, vector N, vector V, float rough)`

`specularBRDF`, [phongBRDF](phongBRDF.html), [blinnBRDF](blinnBRDF.html),
and [diffuseBRDF](diffuseBRDF.html) return the computed BRDF for the
different lighting models used in VEX shading. You can use them in
custom [illuminance](illuminance.html "Loops through all light sources in the scene, calling the light shader for each light source to set the Cl and L global variables.") loops to replicate the lighting models of the
corresponding VEX lighting functions.

```vex
vector nn = normalize(frontface(N, I));
vector ii = normalize(-I);
Cf = 0;
illuminance(P, nn)
{
    vector ll = normalize(L);
    Cf += Cl * (specularBRDF(ll, nn, ii, rough) + diffuseBRDF(ll, nn));
}

```
