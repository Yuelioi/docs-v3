`int  usd_setactive(int stagehandle, string primpath, int flag)`

This function sets the primitive’s active state.

Show/hide arguments

`stagehandle`

`primpath`

The path to the primitive.

`flag`

Non-zero to make the primitive active or 0 to make it inactive.

Returns

The value of `stagehandle` on success or `-1` on failure.
