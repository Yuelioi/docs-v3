`string  usd_makerelationshippath(<stage>stage, string primpath, string name)`

This function returns the full path of a given relationship.

Show/hide arguments

`<stage>`

When running in the context of a node (such as a wrangle LOP), this argument can be an integer representing the input number (starting at 0) to read the stage from. The integer is equivalent to the string form referencing a particular input, e.g., “opinput:0”.

You can also use this argument to refer to a USD file (e.g., “/path/to/file.usd”), or to another LOP node’s cooked stage using the `op:` as the path prefix (e.g., “op:/stage/lop_node”).

`primpath`

The path to the primitive.

`name`

Relationship name.

Returns

The full path of a given relationship.

Examples

## examples

```vex
// Obtain the full path to the relationship "relationship_name" on the cube primitive.
string relationship_path = usd_makerelationshippath(0, "/geo/cube", "relationship_name");

```
