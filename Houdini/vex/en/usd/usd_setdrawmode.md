`int  usd_setdrawmode(int stagehandle, string primpath, string mode)`

This function sets the primitive’s draw mode.

Show/hide arguments

`stagehandle`

`primpath`

The path to the primitive.

`mode`

The draw mode to set the primitive to.

Returns

The value of `stagehandle` on success or `-1` on failure.
