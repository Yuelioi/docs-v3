`int  usd_pointinstance_getbbox(<stage>stage, string primpath, int instance_index, string purpose, vector &min, vector &max)`

This function returns an axis-aligned bounding box for the given instance. The point corresponding to the minimum corner of the bounding box will be returned in min, while the maximum will be in max. Always returns 1.

Show/hide arguments

`<stage>`

When running in the context of a node (such as a wrangle LOP), this argument can be an integer representing the input number (starting at 0) to read the stage from. The integer is equivalent to the string form referencing a particular input, e.g., “opinput:0”.

You can also use this argument to refer to a USD file (e.g., “/path/to/file.usd”), or to another LOP node’s cooked stage using the `op:` as the path prefix (e.g., “op:/stage/lop_node”).

`primpath`

The path to the primitive.

`instance_index`

The index of the instance whose bounding box to return.

`purpose`

The primitive’s purpose for which to return the bounding box (e.g., “render”).

Returns

Always 1.

Examples

## examples

```vex
// Get the bounding box of the first instanced sphere.
vector min, max;
usd_pointinstance_getbbox(0, "/src/instanced_spheres", 0, "render", min, max);
