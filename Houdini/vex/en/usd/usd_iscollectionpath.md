`int  usd_iscollectionpath(<stage>stage, string collectionpath)`

This function checks whether the given path is of a valid collection format.

Show/hide arguments

`<stage>`

When running in the context of a node (such as a wrangle LOP), this argument can be an integer representing the input number (starting at 0) to read the stage from. The integer is equivalent to the string form referencing a particular input, e.g., “opinput:0”.

You can also use this argument to refer to a USD file (e.g., “/path/to/file.usd”), or to another LOP node’s cooked stage using the `op:` as the path prefix (e.g., “op:/stage/lop_node”).

`collectionpath`

The path to the collection.

Returns

`1` if the path is of a valid collection path format, or `0` otherwise.

Examples

## examples

```vex
// Check if string is an acceptable collection path.
int is_valid_collection_path = usd_iscollectionpath(0, "/geo/cube.collection:some_collection");

```
