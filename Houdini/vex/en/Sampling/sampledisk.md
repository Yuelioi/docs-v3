`void  sampledisk(float &x, float &y, float sx, float sy)`

This function warps uniform sample values so that they are equally
distributed on a disk. The transformation attempts to preserve
stratification properties from the original samples.

Show/hide arguments

`x`, `y`

The function overwrites these variables with uniform distributed points within the unit disk.

`sx`, `sy`

Uniform random values in the range `[0,1]`, such as generated by [nextsample](nextsample.html).
