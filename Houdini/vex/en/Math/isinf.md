`int  isinf(float x)`

Returns 1 if the given value is a positive or negative infinity.

Returns 0 if it is a normal number or not a number.

+Inf and -Inf are special value floating point numbers, which represent positive and negative infinities.
They can easily produce NAN, or Not A Number, in further operations
and tend to cause problems with downstream operations.

In traditional programming, these are generated by 1/0 or -1/0, but in VEX
most such operations are guarded so normally VEX will not produce +Inf or -Inf.
