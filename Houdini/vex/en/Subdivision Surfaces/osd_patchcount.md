`int  osd_patchcount(<geometry>geometry)`

Returns the number of base level patches in the subdivision hull specified by the geometry filename. This is different that the number of faces in the subdivision hull. For example, in a tetrahedron, each triangle face will generate three patches.

`int  osd_patchcount(<geometry>geometry, int face_id)`

For a given face in the coarse mesh, this returns the number of patches which are generated by that face. While a quadrilateral only generates 1 patch, all other faces will generate multiple patches based on their vertex count. For example, a triangle will generate 3 patches, a pentagon will generate 5 patches.

Show/hide arguments

`<geometry>`

When running in the context of a node (such as a wrangle SOP), this argument can be an integer representing the input number (starting at 0) to read the geometry from.

Alternatively, the argument can be a string specifying a geometry file (for example, a `.bgeo`) to read from. When running inside Houdini, this can be an `op:/path/to/sop` reference.
