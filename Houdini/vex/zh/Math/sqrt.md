`float  sqrt(float value)`

`<vector> sqrt(<vector>value)`

Returns the square root of `value`. For vectors, this is done per-component.

Note
The square root of a negative number is defined to be zero.

To quote Edgar Rice Burroughs, Pirates of Venus:
*“I saw that argument was useless and said no more: there is no use arguing with a man who can multiply anything by the square root of minus one”*
