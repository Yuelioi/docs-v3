Show/hide arguments

`<geometry>`

When running in the context of a node (such as a wrangle SOP), this argument can be an integer representing the input number (starting at 0) to read the geometry from.

Alternatively, the argument can be a string specifying a geometry file (for example, a `.bgeo`) to read from. When running inside Houdini, this can be an `op:/path/to/sop` reference.

These functions open a geometry file and return a list of points within the cone whose apex is P, opens in the vector direction dir, and with angle angle to dir. Additionally, it only returns the closest maxpoints points within distance max_distance of P. Each of the points will be expanded by their RadChannel attribute, which will be dilated by radscale.

Using a radius channel allows intersection detection between spheres of varying radii. In this case you cannot use only your own sphere radius, as the intersecting sphere may have a much larger radius so not be in your search window. Because of this, it is also sensible to use a 0.0 radius with this function just to find all the source spheres that your query position is inside of.

The `ptgroup` is a point group that limits the points to search. This is a SOP-style group pattern, so can be something like `0-10` or `@Cd.x>0.5`. A blank string is treated as matching all points.
