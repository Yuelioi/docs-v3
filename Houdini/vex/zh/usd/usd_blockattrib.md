`int  usd_blockattrib(int stagehandle, string primpath, string name)`

This function blocks the attribute. I.e., removes all time samples and sets the *block* as default value.

Show/hide arguments

`stagehandle`

`primpath`

The path to the primitive.

`name`

Attribute name.

Returns

The value of `stagehandle` on success, or `-1` on failure.
