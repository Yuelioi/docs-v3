`int  removeattrib(int geohandle, string attribclass, string name)`

Show/hide arguments

`geohandle`

A handle to the geometry to write to. Currently the only valid value is `0` or [geoself](geoself.html "Returns a handle to the current geometry."), which means the current geometry in a node. (This argument may be used in the future to allow writing to other geometries.)

`attribclass`

One of `"detail"` (or `"global"`), `"point"`, `"prim"`, or `"vertex"`.

You can also use `"primgroup"`, `"pointgroup"` or `"vertexgroup"` to [read from groups](../groups.html "You can read the contents of primitive/point/vertex groups in VEX as if they were attributes.").

`name`

The name of the attribute or group to remove.
