Overview

## overview

|  | In Houdini, edges are normally treated as *undirected* and *shared* between faces. However, for some tasks (such as simplifying or cleaning geometry) it is useful to view faces as each having their own edges. |
| --- | --- |
|  | You can think of this as splitting each shared undirected edge along its length into two *half edges*. (Boundary edges of course will only have one “half-edge”.) |
|  | Each half-edge is *directed* (it has a start vertex and an end vertex). |
|  | The half-edge functions let you quickly find a half-edge’s source and destination vertex, the next half-edge, get the other half-edges from the same edge, find all half-edges sharing a given point, and other manipulations. |

Equivalence

## equivalence

Two half-edges are *equivalent* if they are “split” from the same shared edge. In the following figure, three primitives share an edge. The half-edges *e*, *f*, and *g* are *equivalent* because they are from the same edge. Directionality does not matter – *e* is considered equivalent to *f* and *g* even though they have opposite directions.

The source (and destination) vertex of a half-edge uniquely identify it, meaning that there can be at most one half-edge with a given vertex as the source. This is because a vertex can belong to only one primitive. However, because several vertices can be wired to the same point, half-edges can have shared source and destination *points*. Another way of thinking about equivalence is that two half-edges are equivalent if their vertices are shared by the same two points.

One of a set of equivalent half-edges is considered the *primary* half-edge in that class. The VEX functions let you check if a given half-edge is primary, or given a non-primary half-edge, find the equivalent primary half-edge. In the case of an unshared edge, it only has a single primary half-edge.
