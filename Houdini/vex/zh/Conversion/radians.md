`float  radians(float angle_in_degrees)`

Returns the provided angle, that is in degrees, as radians.

`<vector> radians(<vector>nums_in_degs)`

Returns a new vector with `radians()` applied to each component.

Tip
The VEX trig functions work with radians, but most users are more comfortable with degrees. You may want to convert from radians for internal use to degrees in the UI.
