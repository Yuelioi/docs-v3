`float  diffuseBRDF(vector L, vector N)`

Equivalent to clamp(dot(L, N), 0, 1).

`float  diffuseBRDF(vector L, vector N, vector V, float rough)`

[specularBRDF](specularBRDF.html "Returns the computed BRDFs for the different lighting models used in VEX shading."), [phongBRDF](phongBRDF.html), [blinnBRDF](blinnBRDF.html),
and `diffuseBRDF` return the computed BRDF for the
different lighting models used in VEX shading. You can use them in
custom [illuminance](illuminance.html "Loops through all light sources in the scene, calling the light shader for each light source to set the Cl and L global variables.") loops to replicate the lighting models of the
corresponding VEX lighting functions.

See [specularBRDF](specularBRDF.html "Returns the computed BRDFs for the different lighting models used in VEX shading.") for some example code.
