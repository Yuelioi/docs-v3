`intÂ  getptextureid()`

Returns the ptexture id for the current face being shaded. This will typically
be the same as `getprimid()` except in the case of subdivision surfaces. For
subdivision surfaces, mantra splits non-quadrilateral faces into multiple
patches. Each of these split faces is assigned a unique ptexture id.
