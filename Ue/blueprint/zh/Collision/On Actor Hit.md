Called when this Actor hits (or is hit by) something solid. This could happen due to things like Character movement, using Set Location with 'sweep' enabled, or physics simulation.
For events when objects overlap (e.g. walking into a trigger) see the 'Overlap' event.

For collisions during physics simulation to generate hit events, 'Simulation Generates Hit Events' must be enabled.
