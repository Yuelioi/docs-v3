Set the relative location and rotation of the component to put it at the supplied pose in world space.

Target is Scene Component

## Inputs

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| exec | In |  |
| object | Target |  |
| vector | New Location | New location in world space for the component. |
| rotator | New Rotation | New rotation in world space for the component. |
| boolean | Sweep | Whether we sweep to the destination location, triggering overlaps along the way and stopping short of the target if blocked by something. Only the root component is swept and checked for blocking collision, child components move without sweeping. If collision is off, this has no effect. |
| boolean | Teleport | Whether we teleport the physics state (if physics collision is enabled for this object). If true, physics velocity for this object is unchanged (so ragdoll parts are not affected by change in location). If false, physics velocity is updated based on the change in position (affecting ragdoll parts). If CCD is on and not teleporting, this will affect objects along the entire sweep volume. |

## Outputs

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| exec | Out |  |
| struct | Sweep Hit Result | Hit result from any impact if sweep is true. |
