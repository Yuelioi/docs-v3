Get Movie Graph Render Layer Subsystem (World Subsystem)

The primary means of controlling render layers in MRQ. Render layers can be added/registered with the subsystem, then
made active in order to view them. Collections and modifiers can also be viewed, but they do not need to be added to
the subsystem ahead of time.
